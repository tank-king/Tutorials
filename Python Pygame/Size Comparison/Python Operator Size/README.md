# Python Operator Size Comparison

Ever saw the Universe Size Comparison videos and wondered if someone would make one about python operators? No? Well, here is one anyway: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuvzreKzW6Q

The "size" of each operator is based on their precedence.
Official list of precedence (python 3.12): https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence

While there is no official way to sort operators with same precedence, I ordered them in non-increasing order from left to right. This is because each operator needed to be "bigger" than its previous one.

This code has been used to generate the video.
I have not included the fonts in this repository, but to run the code, you need to have the following files:
- font1.ttf
- font3.ttf
- bg.png
